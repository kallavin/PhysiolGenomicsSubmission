# Physiol Genomics Submission
*Supplementary tables to accompany submission by Lavin, et al. to Physiological Genomics (March 2019)*

**[Table S1] Lightcyan module members**: 834 transcripts placed in the lightcyan module using WGCNA as described in the Methods.

**[Table S2] Skyblue module members**: 691 transcripts placed in the skyblue module using WGCNA as described in the Methods.

**[Table S3] Lightcyan annotation**: Manual annotation of transcripts with the highest membership in lightcyan, highest significance to percent type I grouped, and classified by biomaRt as protein-coding or miRNA. 

**[Table S3] Skyblue annotation**: Manual annotation of transcripts with the highest membership in skyblue, highest significance to mean group size, and classified by biomaRt as protein-coding or miRNA. 

**[Table S5] DESeq2 OA vs PD**: Summary of findings from single gene-level analysis comparing expression in individuals with Parkinson's disease to age-matched healthy older adults.

**[Table S6] DESeq2 PD vs. non-PD**: Summary of findings from single gene-level analysis comparing expression in individuals with Parkinson's disease to healthy adults (both old and young), and covarying for subject age.
